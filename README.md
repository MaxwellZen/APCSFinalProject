Brief Project Description:  2D soft body simulation composed of many particles connected by springs. We'd implement spring physics and rigid body collision, and let the user change parameters like spring strength, gravity, particle density, and friction. Also, if we have time, we could repurpose the same mechanics to simulate other interesting things.
