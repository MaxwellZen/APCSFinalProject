Group Members: Jerry Liang, Maxwell Zen\

Brief Project Description:  2D soft body simulation composed of many particles connected by springs. We'd implement spring physics and rigid body collision, and let the user change parameters like spring strength, gravity, particle density, and friction. Also, if we have time, we could repurpose the same mechanics to simulate other interesting things. \

Jerry: Worked on the Particle class; wrote all of the constructors, get methods, and update methods (applyForce and updatePosition). Reached solution with Maxwell about how to create a standard time measure (we decided on creating a new class called Stage which has a public static void time variable).
