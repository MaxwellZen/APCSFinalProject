Group Name: Springing into Action\

Group Members: Jerry Liang, Maxwell Zen\

Brief Project Description:  2D soft body simulation composed of many particles connected by springs. We'd implement spring physics and rigid body collision, and let the user change parameters like spring strength, gravity, particle density, and friction. Also, if we have time, we could repurpose the same mechanics to simulate other interesting things. \

Development Log:\
\
5/25:\
\
Jerry: Worked on the Particle class; wrote all of the constructors, get methods, and update methods (applyForce and updatePosition). Reached solution with Maxwell about how to create a standard time measure (we decided on creating a new class called Stage which has a public static void time variable). \
\
Maxwell: Worked on the Spring class, including the constructors, get methods, and the updateForce method which implements Hooke's Law to calculate the force on each particle. \
\
5/26: \
\
Maxwell: Created the Stage class and filled in the static variables and methods.\
\
Jerry: Wrote and tested display method for Particle, Spring, and SoftBody classes. Wrote rectangular constructor for SoftBody class and also fixed error with static class with Maxwell. Outside of coding, also updated UML diagram to fit current structure.
